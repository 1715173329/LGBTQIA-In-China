                            <h2>What is LGBTQIA ? </h2>
                            <p><strong>LGBTQIA</strong> is an acronym, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersexual, asexual, sexual minorities that need to be respected because we are born with it.

                            <h2>Why was this project established ? </h2>
                            <p>Due to Chinese traditional cultural background, LGBTQIA is very unpopular in China and cannot be recognized and respected by others. The purpose of this project is to find LGBTQIA among open-source workers or those who support LGBTQIA's equal rights, so as to improve the situation of LGBTQIA in China from public opinion. Although the impact will not be great, it is better than none.</p>

                            <h2>Why does LGBTQIA need equal rights ?</h2>
                            <p>Because LGBTQIA is a minority, although LGBTQIA is also ordinary people, it can not be denied that we are different from the majority of heterosexuals, and political rights can not be fully protected. Freedom and equality are always the most important in modern society. In China, LGBTQIA has not got real freedom and equality. In order to let such people live a normal life, we need to fight for equal rights.</p>

                            <h2>How to respect LGBTQIA ?</h2>
                            <p>You just need to treat LGBTQIA as ordinary people, just as you respect any friend around you. Remember that LGBTQIA is not a disease in any form, even if you have physiological differences, LGBTQIA is normal. At the same time, LGBTQIA really needs more care than heterosexual, because LGBTQIA often lacks a sense of security and is eager to be recognized.</p>
